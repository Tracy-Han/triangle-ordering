1. clock ticks
  - take the accurate gpu commands rendering time
  - one is to compute the rendering times, time appropriate to ovr
  - another we need to count also the pick which face index we want,ours need to selection time
1.1 to upload the faceinto the gpu first
  - bind face index buffer later 
  - glDrawArrays
1.2 change viewpoints later

2. simple shader
  - the increase should be appropriate to OVR
  - OVR drawed/showed. showed if fixed, then more drawed,more pixel shader time for a same model with same viewpoint
  - we could count the ovr and the drawing time
2.1 one only drawing time/one picking viewpoints
2.2 original/ours/tipsy?
3. expensive shader
3.1 drawing time/one picking viewpoints
3.2 origianl/ours/tipsy?
4. ambient occlusion


final: one video with 12 numbers for compare.
1. finish 8 numbers today.
1. ovr of the original face computation
2. time for selection 
3. copy the ambient occlusio to the new file
