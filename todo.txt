if the assignments is right , then the patchSort and new Face is right, only need to check the ratio get is right or not
1. make the ratio[75][5][162]; the only one constant. and each time make it 0; and every APPmain() give the new ratio results; make assignment and minRatio
-- need to check if assignment is right
-- 20 minutes
2. see if the camera view is right ; random test 10 
-- 15minutes

3. new mean is same? -10minutes

4. for new and old ratio, just count the atomic counter numbers. one is with old main another is with new mean
- get the cameraIds[numFrames][162], count[numFrames] 10 minutes
- new transformatrix ?? 1h
- atomic count 
- for compare the ratio
// new load triangles() for fullTransformMatrix
// and without overdraw ratio
//or another method is read the ratios of the right ones
    
5. check if new ratio is small or not -30minutes

3. check the (glm::mat4 * )piScratch ; if it is right. 10 minutes
  -- std::cout<<glm::to_String(piScratch); 
  -- imitate the (clusterSort *) piScratch
5. read int and char *, see what is the numbers 2h 
    - try with script 
done
