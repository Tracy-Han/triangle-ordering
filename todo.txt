To finish on Wednesday
1. one animation  - Kachujin Animation 1
2. obj files to get the vertex x,y,z, normal, uv
    - before moved per frame
    - move the animation to center,output new vertice positions (matlab 15 minutes,new output vertices)
    - update new obj (maya 5 minutes)
3. 5 means file and assignments (10 minutes)
    - only need to change the vertices positions(just slightly)
4. SSAO code(45minutes)
    - where to get vertice
    - where to get faceindex
    - where to get MVP matrix
5. test with SSAO (2hour)
    - without texture
    - with texture
    - with shadow
6. face index 
    - upload once?
    - which is most fastest for our test
    - which is most reasonable for our test
    - faces upload once, and choose which to render
    - update view matrix, update face (change which face, use always linear face), after 300, update vertices.(realtime useage)
