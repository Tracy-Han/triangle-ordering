if the assignments is right , then the patchSort and new Face is right, only need to check the ratio get is right or not

1. if only rotate the model, will the overdraw ratio change (shouldn't change) (drawElementBasedInstance(1,0)) 
    -- camera need slightly change because of the transformation is not right  1.0h
2. see, 162 viewpoints, 13 x , 13 y. drawed position, read positions? 15 minutes
    
3. check the (glm::mat4 * )piScratch ; if it is right. 10 minutes
  -- std::cout<<glm::to_String(piScratch); 
  -- imitate the (clusterSort *) piScratch
4. change the buffer set, don't want defines 15 minutes
5. read int and char *, see what is the numbers 2h 
6. try with script 
7. done
