2. test if overdraw ratio is the same (compared with webgl with same face,same frame and save viewpoint) (drawElementBasedInstance(1,0))
    -- shouldn't have big differences, prove the overdraw ratio is right
    -- the first two is same, but the third might be different

3. if only rotate the model, will the overdraw ratio change (shouldn't change) (drawElementBasedInstance(1,0)) 
    -- just slightly change the up vector and then rerun 
    -- then it's okay to use the transformations now to compute, the allRatios get is right 

4. test if assignments and minratios is the same ? (for ratios set a boudary)
    -- or just test if the allRatios is under control right

5. test if new mean is right.

6. test if the account number is smaller, then the overdraw ratio is smaller
    - just use two faces , run two times and see 

7. check the (glm::mat4 * )piScratch ; if it is right.
  -- std::cout<<glm::to_String(piScratch); 
  -- imitate the (clusterSort *) piScratch
8.
