if the assignments is right , then the patchSort and new Face is right, only need to check the ratio get is right or not

assignments slightly different for 162*30 only 3 are different
1. viewpoints reset. reRun the results.

2. runtime selection.

- by noon ,sent the consuming time and averatge overdraw ratio


-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 runtime selection, meansfile, assignemnts, considering only take 6 minutes, first debugging 25minutes
just compare the 30s ï¼Œ get overdraw ratio of random viewpoints. 300 viewpoints. 
How to test these 300 viewpoints.
- draw canvas one time 300 * numFrames 30 minutes
- draw 2 * numFrames *5 (but cost more memory and need to get the ID location)
- (if count < 162), then it's fine,counts, cameraIds,mean overdraw ratio,
- cut to 5 faces

1.4 expensive shader, test the time.
    - use the previous viewpoints, using one canvas. How to just draw One canvas, it's needed
    - feel the difference 30 minutes
    
2. the tipsyRatio and the original ratio. See if the the overdraw ratio is also slightly higher
    - 20 minutes
    
2.2 tipsyRatio(lamda = 0.85; lamda = 3),
    - read in the face files or compute by code (prefer compute by code)
    - how to reset the code to make it clean, render is the render party, make it three parts, initial canvas, render, overdrawRatio
    - render party change the numFrames
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't want to reset all the graphes, because the results are very similar, and this results is already not very accurate. Because it depends on the initial choose. Maybe movie don't need change because it's only one camera.

But I would like to do the results of the runtime tests. 

3. numClusters? should I change? 
4. alphas? Should I change?
original ratio, 
done
