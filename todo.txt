if the assignments is right , then the patchSort and new Face is right, only need to check the ratio get is right or not

3. if only rotate the model, will the overdraw ratio change (shouldn't change) (drawElementBasedInstance(1,0)) 
    -- just slightly change the up vector and then rerun 
    -- then it's okay to use the transformations now to compute, the allRatios get is right 
    -- camera need slightly change because of the transformation is not right
    
7. check the (glm::mat4 * )piScratch ; if it is right.
  -- std::cout<<glm::to_String(piScratch); 
  -- imitate the (clusterSort *) piScratch
8.
