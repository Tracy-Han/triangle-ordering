To finish on Wednesday
1. one animation  - Kachujin Animation 1
2. obj files to get the vertex x,y,z, normal, uv
    - before moved per frame
    - move the animation to center,output new vertice positions (matlab 15 minutes,new output vertices)
    - update new obj (maya 5 minutes)
3. 5 means file and assignments (10 minutes)
    - only need to change the vertices positions(just slightly)
4. SSAO code(45minutes)
    - where to get vertice
    - where to get faceindex
    - where to get MVP matrix
5. test with SSAO (2hour)
    - without texture
    - with texture
    - with shadow
6. face index 
    - upload once?
    - which is most fastest for our test
    - which is most reasonable for our test
    - faces upload once, and choose which to render
    - update view matrix, update face (change which face, use always linear face), after 300, update vertices.(realtime useage)
    
7. uv coordinates 
    obj file give more uv pair than vertices posiitons. how to deal with 
    not very accurate
